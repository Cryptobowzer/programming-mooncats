# Inside k - The 2nd Byte in the 5-Byte Mooncat ID - All About Pose / Facing / Face / Fur


Let's start with the "MoonCat "k" values explained" visual:

Let's break apart the `0x00571281e7` cat id example
from the visual:

``` ruby
id  = '0x00571281e7'
snd = id[4,2]    # take 2 chars (starting at position 4)
#=> "57"
```

Note:  "57" is a hex string (use `snd.hex` to convert to number).
Let's print out the 0s and 1s, that is, the 8-digit binary number:

``` ruby
bits = '%08b' % snd.hex
#=> "01010111"
```

And let's break apart the different
different factors
that make up the cat's pose, fur pattern, and facial expression
bit-by-bit:

``` ruby
invert = bits[0,1]  # take 1 char (starting at position 0)
#=> "0"
facing = bits[1,1]  # take 1 char (starting at position 1)
#=> "1"
face   = bits[2,2]  # take 2 chars (starting at position 2)
#=> "01
fur    = bits[4,2]  # take 2 chars (starting at position 4)
#=> "01"
pose   = bits[6,2]  # take 2 chars (starting at position 6)
#=> "11"
```

Looking up the mapping from the visual by "hand" you will get:

- Inverted Colors? - 0: No
- Facing - 1: Right
- Face - 01:  Frown (Look Down)
- Fur  - 01:  Striped
- Pose - 11: Stalking


Let's try again - re(using) the mooncats library:

``` ruby
require 'mooncats'

meta = Mooncats::Metadata.new( '0x00571281e7' )
meta.invert?   #=> false
meta.facing    #=> "Right"
meta.face      #=> "Frown (Look Down)"
meta.fur       #=> "Striped"
meta.pose      #=> "Stalking"
```


## Bonus:  128 True Official Genuine Mooncat™ MD5-Verified Original Designs

Yes, the pose (4), face (4), fur (4), and facing (2) attributes
make up all the possible 128 designs, that is, `4 x 4 x 4 x 2 = 128`.

"Remove" the first bit, that is, the Inverted Colors? bit
and you will get the design (0 to 127):

``` ruby
snd = "57"
snd.hex % 128
#=> 87
```

Voila! Design Right·Frown (Look Down)·Striped·Stalking
is #87.

Or re(using) the mooncats library machinery:

``` ruby
meta.design.to_i
#=> 87
```

Let's double check:

``` ruby
design = Mooncats::Metadata::Design.new( 87 )
design.facing   #=> "Right"
design.face     #=> "Frown (Look Down)"
design.fur      #=> "Striped"
design.pose     #=> "Stalking"
```
